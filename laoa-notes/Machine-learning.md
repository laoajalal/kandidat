# Machine learning
Machine learning grew out of work in [Artificial intelligence](Artificial-intelligence.md). It main goals are to give computers new capabilities. These can be:
1. Database mining: Large datasets from growth of automation. These can range from medical records to engineering data.
2. Some applications are too hard for us humans to model. With the help of machine learning, things like autonomous helicopters, handwriting recognition, [NLP](natural-language-processing.md) and many more.

## Definition of Machine learning
So, whats the definiton of machine learning? One informal variant is: "Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicity programmed". Another more formal is: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E".

## Types of algorthims
Machine learning has 2 major ways of learning, supervised and unsupervised. There are others also, for instance reinforcement learning which is comon inside games where the computer learns when it is rewarded, more on this here [Reinforcement learning](reinforcement-learning.md)

### Supervised learning
Supervised learning is used when we know the correct output beforehand. More formally, we are given a data set and already known correct output, there should be a relationship between the input and output. We can further categorize supervised learning into 2 categories: [Regression problems](Regression-problems.md) and [Classification problems](classification-problems.md).

### Unsupervised learning
When we approach problems with little to no knowledge about how our expected results should look like, unsupervised learning is a good approach. Instead of modeling a function like we do in supervised learning, we cluster the data based on relationshipts amoung the variables in the data. There is no feedback based on the prediction results.
**Example**: If we have a collection of genes, we can find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are close to each one, or related by different variables. These could range from lifespan, color, location etc.
