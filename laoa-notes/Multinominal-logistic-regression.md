# Multinominal logistic regression
- Generalization of logistic regression, whereas normal logisitc regression only has 2 possible outcomes, "yes or no".
- Enables predictions (classifications) on n number of elements.
- Also called Maximum entropy classifier
- Unlike Naive-Bayes, MaxEnt does not assume that the features are independent of each other.

- It is often used when we can not assume the conditional independence of the features. We are working with text, which obviously has a dependent relation with each other in a sentence, thus MaxEnt works great for Text classifications. 
- However, it needs more training time than Naive-Bayes to become as efficient.
