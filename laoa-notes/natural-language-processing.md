# Natural Language
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the application of computational methods to model and extract information from human langugage. To understand how NLP works, we must first define what a **natural language** is.

## Natural Language
There are about 170.000 words in the english vocabulary. About 10.000 are used on a daily basis, where these can build up complex sentences. These sentences can express different types of emotion or feeling, depending on the context. For example, a news article may use the same words as a scientific report. These 2 are very different from each other, atleast regarding their context, but wordwise, they can be very similar.  

As desrcibed above, languages can become very complex, we need to categorize different aspects of natural languages.
1. Morphology: refers to shape and the internal structure of the word.
2. Lexical: segment the text into meaninful units, like words. e.g.(Hi my name is Laoa == Hi | my| name| is| Laoa)
3. Syntax: Rules applied to words, sentences and phrases e.g. words has different forms (like/likes etc)
4. Semantics: Meaning of words in a sentence
5. Discourse: relationships that exists among sentences e.g. (Hi my name is Laoa. I like to program). These 2 sentences are somewhat connected regarding the information from prior
6. Pragmatics: Meaning through speakers intenet 

NLP seeks to map language to representations that captures the above listed categorys, which can then be processed by different Machine learning methods. The choice in which the langugage are represented can lead to different results, depending on which ML algorthim that is used for the time being.
