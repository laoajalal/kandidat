# Meeting Notes: 28-01-2021

#### Questions
- Naive based, any other specific, or up to us completely

### Notes
- Mention that we work in a agile way, 2 week intervals
- 2-3, itterative evaluation
- doesnt make sense to investigate more than 3
- make a priority list of algorithms we want to look at
- the conditions the algorithms performs well under?  
  - e.g. can you tune the parameters so that it performs better?
- Parameter of the theisis, trying to apply NLP to code, that is not so natural,  
  what sort of input, e.g. keywords "if", "else", et.c., need to do some preprocessing
  "can toy around with the information that u want to process"
  - Be a part of the implementation
  - picks parts of the code you want  to look at
- Next week:
    - what kind of pre-processing,
    - start jumping into the cold water, start doing something

- half implementation/research, half evaluation
- push back chapter writing to april
- shorten implementation
- writing is overal half of the work


- Next week:
    - what did what,
    - someone focused on mallet
    - someone focused on background
