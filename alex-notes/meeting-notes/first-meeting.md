# First Meeting
Training data
suggestions on how to get started

- MÃ¥l skapa arbetsplan 

- supervised learning:
    - learns by example:
       
- have time for writing:
    - 8-10 weeks for writing
- Evaluate different machine learning algorithms:
    - one picks 2
    - the other picks 2

- What can we do?
- what options are there?
- what tools to use?

- Would like to see something more interactive than the report,   
  - The classifier is trained to decied where the souce code belongs
      - interactive learning, dynamically learning:
          - can defince parameters, threshold
          - try naive base:
              - gives a relative fraction of if its, or dont recomend anything
          - and otheres:
              - should be fast
              - important to understand to understand how quick the learning  
                can be
              - compare:
                  - currency of the classifier (how good it is)
                  - how fast it is on learning
- recive a outline from sebastian
- reread the RELAX paper
